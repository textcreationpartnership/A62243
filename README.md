SEVERAL EPISTLES To the Reverend Dr. TILLOTSON DEAN of CANTERBURY. WHEREIN The Nature, the Immortali
    _ The Author's Apology for his Writing. To the Reverend John Tillotson D. D. DEAN of CANTERBURY.

    _ EPIST. II. Wherein he treats of the cause of Action, or Motion, under the notion of Spirit; and endeavours to shew our often mistakes in applying our thoughts and actions to the operation of that Spirit of truth in us, which though good in themselves, may proceed from other cause; and advises to solitude at particular seasons, as the most ready and likely way to behold, in some degree, the light of truth.

    _ EPIST. III. Wherein the Author sets down some further grounds and reasons of his opinion of the mortality, or utter annihilation of the Souls of brutes upon their death: And therein indeavours to clear himself of all seeds and principles of Atheism, wherewith that opinion seems taxed, in a certain Book presented him by the said Dean.

    _ EPIST. IV. Wherein he treats of Mans Ignorance, in his search into the most ordinary Work of Nature, and concludes how much more dim-sighted we are, when we look into the frame and structure of Mans Soul; The most admirable effect of the Divine Power, working here below.

    _ EPIST. V. Wherein he further illustrates the inherent or native Power, and predominancy of the affections, above other faculties of the Soul; but more particularly treats of the Imagination, its deception, its supplying the place of Reason in us, our miseries thereby, and the remedies against its Delusion.

    _ EPIST. VI. Wherein the Author treats of the various impress of the Divine Power, upon each particular created substance, more especially upon the Souls of Men: And further shews, how proue we are to mistake about the case and temper of others and our own, and that they generally are not, what they seem: And thence proceeds to discourse of Friendship, and of Love.

    _ EPIST. VII. Of the different vain pursuits of the Souls of Men, wherein we are ready to accuse each other of Folly, though not our selves, and yet are all Fools in some degree. That no pursuit of the Soul here, is praise-worthy or commendable, further than it intentionally advances God's Glory, which is the mark set before us, and which if we do not behold, in all our travails, our labour will not profit.

    _ EPIST. VIII. That any compleat Happiness here, is a thing meerly in speculation. That natural indowments or excellencies in the Soul, do conduce to the Ease, Peace, or quiet thereof, and so are desirable though we attain not happiness thereby. Learning or Knowledge, Wisdom, Prudence, and subtilty considered. That even Prudence the most likely conduct to happiness, was never yet the constant concomitant of the clearest or brightest human Soul.

    _ Epist. IX. Wherein the Author maintains Divine Wisdom and Providence, ruling in, and over the Soul of man, more especially, and more apparently (if considered) than any work of the Creation: And that the Affections in the heart of man seem that part of the Soul, whereon God more especially exercises his prerogative, moulding and changing them on the suddain, to his secret purposes, beyond, and even contrary to any foresight, conjecture, or Imagination of the very Soul it self.

    _ EPIST. X. Of Credulity, and Incredulity, the rise of both, and that Credulity of the two, is of more pernitious consequence. And of the Evil of imposing on others, or creating or raising a belief on false or uncertain Principles.

      * A PRAYER of the AUTHOR'S, unto Almighty God, for the Guidance and well government of our Souls, and the discovery and prevention of such Mistakes and mischiefs (whether publick or private) arising from thence, as in the foregoing Tracts and Epistles are more especially discoursed of.
